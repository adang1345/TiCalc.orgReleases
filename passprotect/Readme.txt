Password Protector by Aohan Dang

Description
Password protect your calculator. You may choose what password to use. When running this program,
the ON key is disabled. The source code of this program contains the password you choose, but the
code is designed to trick people who are not experts into thinking they cannot find your password
in the source code.

How to install and run
Send pass.89p to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium. To choose your password, open the program with the
program editor and press F5. Type abc in the dialog box, and you should jump to a section that
says If p="abc". Replace abc with the password you want to use. To start the password protection,
type pass() on the home screen and press ENTER. You may turn the calculator off. If you forget
your password while the program is running, there is a way to end the program. Press ON many times
quickly until an error pops up. Depending on how fast you are able to push it and how lucky you
are, it might take some time for the error to pop up. If this fails (which is unlikely), the only
other way is to reset the calculator by pressing 2nd, left, and right at the same time and then
ON. This ends the program but also resets all RAM, so use this only as a last resort. If you are
worried this might happen to you because you are forgetful and have slow fingers, you should
archive your variables so they don't get deleted if you reset the calculator. You should do this
in only the most extreme case in which repeatedly pushing the ON key does not work.
