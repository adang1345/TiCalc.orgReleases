Amino Acids by Aohan Dang

Description
Enter an mRNA codon and find its corresponding amino acid.

How to install and run
Send amino.89f to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium. The correct syntax is amino("mRNA codon").
Be sure to use the quotes. The codon is three capital letters using A, U, C, or G. Make sure
you do not make the mistake of entering the tRNA codon instead of the mRNA codon.
