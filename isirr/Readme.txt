IsIrrational by Aohan Dang

Description
Test whether a value is irrational.

How to install and run
Send isirr.89f to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium. The correct syntax is isirr(value). If you find
a fault in this function and it gives an incorrect answer, email which value causes the fault
to adang1345@gmail.com. I have tested this function with values written in many forms, but I
don't know if I missed any.
