IsVar by Aohan Dang

Description
One compatibility issue exists between the TI-89 and TI-89 Titanium. The TI-89 does not
have the function isVar, so if a program designed for the TI-89 Titanium uses the isVar function
and is run on a TI-89, an error occurs. This program is for the original TI-89 and replicates
the isVar function to prevent this compatibility issue.

How to install and run
Send isVar.89f to your TI-89.
