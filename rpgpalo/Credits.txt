                   increasing difficulty level, and featuring in a cartoon
Jeremy Gannon-     for featuring in a cartoon
Daniel Guodace-    for encouraging me to add more humorous news stories and increasing the
                   difficulty of enemies

Greg Han-	   for showing me two bugs and one fix to prevent the game from being too easy

                   RPG

                   me find the "isVar" function does not work on all 68k calculators
Ian Quartucci-     for showing me loading time took too long, so I decreased loading time
Dominic Shaedler-  for showing me eating speed was too slow, so I increased the speed
Carl Verch-        for testing how fun the game is
