List Remove by Aohan Dang

Description
Remove an element from a list by inputting the list and which element to remove. Included are
a program and a function. The function returns the list with the element removed, and the program
stores the list with the element removed as the variable mtemp.

How to install and run
Send listrm.89p and/or listrm.89f to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium. The correct syntax for listrm
is listrm(list,number of the element to remove). This program removes the indicated element from
the list and stores the new list as the variable mtemp. You may rename mtemp. The correct syntax
for listrmf is listrmf(list,number of the element to remove). Unlike the program, this function
outputs the new list with the element removed but does not store it as a variable.
