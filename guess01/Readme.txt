Guess01 v1.0 by Aohan Dang


Description
You can play against the calculator or a friend. A range of numbers is specified, and you try
to guess the number the calc or your friend thinks. The calc outputs a hint whether the number
it is thinking is higher or lower than your guess. At the end, the calc displays the number of
turns you took to guess the number.

How to install and run
