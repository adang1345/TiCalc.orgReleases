cDNA by Aohan Dang

Description
Input the nitrogenous bases of an mRNA strand and output the bases of its complementary
DNA strand. This simulates the creation of cDNA when reverse transcriptase is applied
to mRNA.

How to install and run
Send cdna.89f to your TI-89. The correct syntax is cdna("bases"). You may use A, U, C, or G
as bases, for example "AUUCGGCCAAUUUCGUA".
