Triangle Type by Aohan Dang

Description
Input the lengths of 3 sides of a triangle and find if the triangle is right, acute, or
obtuse.

How to install and run
Send tritype.89f to your TI-89. The correct syntax is tritype(side1,side2,side3). If you
give side lengths that cannot exist on a triangle because they violate the triangle
inequality theorem, the function returns "nonexistant."
