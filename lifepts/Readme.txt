Yu-Gi-Oh Lifepoint Counter by Aohan Dang

Description
Keep track of your lifepoints more easily in a Yu-Gi-Oh duel.

How to install and run
Send lifepts.89p to your TI-89. Type lifepts() on the home screen and press ENTER.
Use the F1-F3 keys to add or subtract lifepoints or quit. If two attack position
monsters battle and you lose lifepoints because of it, you can type in the number of
lifepoints lost as a subtraction expression, for example, 2000-1600 instead of doing the
math in your head.
