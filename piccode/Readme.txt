Picture Code by Aohan Dang

Description
Generate the code of the image on the graph screen.

How to install and run
Send piccode.89p and pxlonm.89p to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium. Run the program by typing
piccode() and pressing ENTER while the picture is on the graph screen. You should use this
program only when not much of the graph screen is black, such as when the graph screen contains
only a few lines or basic shapes. Otherwise, this program will take too long and take up too
much RAM. If only a small part of the graph screen is filled, the program should take about
4 minutes. This program is for the convenience of storing the information on the graph screen
without saving the graph as a GDB or Pic. Storing the information this way is efficient only
if not much of the graph screen is filled. The code of the picture is stored as the variable
c. To regenerate the image, use the program pxlonm. The correct syntax is pxlonm(picture code).
