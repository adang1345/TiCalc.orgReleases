GCD and LCM Pack by Aohan Dang

Description
The TI-89's gcd() function and lcm() function allow you to find the GCD or LCM of only two
integers at a time. Included are custom functions that allow you to find the GCD or LCM of
three or four integers.

How to install and use
Send gcd3.89f, gcd4.89f, lcm3.89f, and lcm4.89f to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium.
These are the correct syntaxes:
gcd3(integer1,integer2,integer3)
gcd4(integer1,integer2,integer3,integer4)
lcm3(integer1,integer2,integer3)
lcm4(integer1,integer2,integer3,integer4)
