Rubik's Cube Stackmat Timer 1.0 by Aohan Dang (adang1345@gmail.com)

Description
Use the calculator as a virtual Stackmat timer for timing Rubik's Cube solves.

How to install and run
Send stackmat.89p and exprcomb.89f to your TI-89 or TI-89 Titanium. Type stackmat() on the home
screen and press ENTER. The program first generates a random 20-move scramble. After scrambling
your cube, turn the calculator into a horizontal position. Place your left hand near or on the
arrow keys and place your right hand so that your index finger rests above the ENTER key. Your
hands should be resting in a position similar to using a Stackmat timer. Put the cube between
your hands. To start the timer, press ENTER with your right index finger and pick up the cube.
When you finish solving, release the cube and slam your hands onto the keys. Be sure one of the
keys you hit is ENTER because that stops the timer. The calculator then displays the time in
seconds. At this point, press ESC to quit or 8 to solve again.

A side effect of the program is it sets
the "Exact/Approx" mode to "EXACT."
